# Atario

## Description
Atario is a top-down action game. The game allows the user to shoot and move around in cardinal directions. As the time goes on the blocks speed up, to add a gradual difficulty. The program was planned to have high scores, but those have sadly not yet been implemented. The goal is the longest survival.
